This is a Dockerfile for the latest lucansnz version of pyTivo

For maximum flexibility on file transfers, run it in host mode:
```
docker run -d --net="host" --name="pytivo" -v /path/to/media/:/media -v /path/to/config:/config -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro pinion/docker-pytivo

```

If you don't need to push files (see below), you can use bridge mode:
```
docker run -p 9032:9032 -p 2190:2190/udp -d -h unraid --name="pytivo" -v /path/to/media/:/media -v /path/to/config:/config -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro pinion/docker-pytivo

```


After installing, go to http://server:9032/ and click "settings"
* Select "Global Server Settings"
* No need to set paths for ffmpeg, tivodecode and tdcat, they will be found automatically
* Although if you find it's not working set them to /usr/local/bin/tivodecode and /usr/local/bin/tdcat
* Set the beacon to the IP address of your TiVo, followed by " listen".  i.e.: "192.168.1.5 listen"
* Set your tivo_username and tivo_password if you want to push files to your TiVo
* Set your tivo_mak if you want tivodecode to automatically decrypt the .tivo file to .mpg
* Set the togo_path to /media or whatever is appropriate for your system
* Click "Save Changes"
* Select "MyMovies"
* Set the path to /media or whatever is appropriate for your system
* Click "Save Changes"
* Click "Restart pyTivo"
* After about 10 seconds, return to the pyTivo home page and you should see your TiVo in the list.

For additional help on the settings, see: http://pytivo.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Configure_pyTivo

Not sure how to find your TiVo Media Access Key (MAK)? See http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+my+tivo+mak

You have three options for transferring files:
* Using the pyTivo web interface, you can pull files from the TiVo.  
  The transfer will start immediately and there is an option to automatically decrypt the file.
  Note: If you have the option to "transfer as mpeg-ts" and it fails, try disabling it.
* Using the TiVo "Now Playing" interface, you can pull files from pyTivo.  
  The transfer will start immediately and they will automatically converted to a format the Tivo can handle.
* Using the pyTivo web interface you can push files to the TiVo.  
  This request goes through the Tivo.com servers so there is a random delay before the transfer starts.
  Once it starts, pyTivo will automatically convert the file to a format the TiVo can handle.

There are other pros and cons of each, for more info see http://lmgtfy.com/?q=pytivo+push+vs+pull
